            <h2>Course objectives</h2>
            <p>This three-credit course introduces students to conceptualizing and producing content across multiple platforms--from Web sites to tablets and mobile devices-- by exploring essential concepts, tools and interactive story forms.</p> 

            <p>This course explores how the news industry is adapting to new technologies and ways to map or illustrate data and news. Students will also explore ways to add interactivity to audio and visual storytelling. </p>

            <p>More specifically, this course introduces students to the basics of HTML/CSS and a touch of JavaScript.They'll also leverage existing frameworks, libraries and content management systems (WordPress).</p>

            <p>We'll explore all these tools and technologies within the journalistic context of pitching, reporting, producing data and interactive-rich news packages.</p>

            <p>The course covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</p>

           <h2>Story Guidelines</h2>

            <p>Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well.</p>
            
            <p>Every story you produce for our class should include clear source information for any data or images that you did not produce yourself.</p>

            <h2>Grading Assessment</h2>

            <h4>For all assignments</h4>

           <p>In assessing students' work, the instructor will focus on the following factors applicable to all assignments (specific criteria for each assignment will be detailed later):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Process: Were the drafts iterated and improved based on faculty feedback?</li>
                <li>Quality and Shine: Is it executed with skill and subtlety, and has it been edited well and polished?</li>
                <li>Organization and Presentation: Is it presented clearly and in a professional manner suitable for an audience?</li>
                <li>Effort and Application: Has the work been prepared with careful thought and attention to detail, and does it take appropriate advantage of the relevant tools?</li>
                <li>Punctuality and Completeness: Is it on time and complete, and does it fulfill the assignment?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>For Discussions</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Preparedness: Has the student completed the work necessary in preparation for the discussion (viewing assigned video, completing assigned reading or tutorial)? </li>
                <li>Participation: Was the student engaged in the discussion (both paying attention and participating)?</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>For In-class Exercises</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Effort: Did the student try to complete the exercise to better understand the lesson at hand?</li>
                <li>Participation: If the exercise involves collaboration, did the student contribute?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Assignment Values</h2>
 
            <p>Grading for individual assignments is based on the level of professionalism of the finished work:
            </br><b>A</b> being professional quality work with minimal editing required.
            </br><b>B</b> being good quality student work. 
            </br><b>C</b> being unsatisfactory work.
            </br><b>F</b> being atrocious, unacceptable work.</p>

            <p>Grading for the class as a whole will be based on your overall performance, with the weights of assignment and other grades as follows:</p>

            <img src="http://lamivo.com/images/opening_image.jpg">
            <p><a href="mailto:lam.vo@journalism.cuny.edu" target="_blank">lam.vo@journalism.cuny.edu</a></p>
            <p>I'm <a href="http://lamthuyvo.com" target="_blank">an interactive editor for Al Jazeera America</a>, where I lead a team of coder-journalists and cover poverty-related stories. Before coming to Al Jazeera, I was a multimedia producer for NPR's Planet Money where I created interactives, data visualizations, videos and photographs to explain economic issues in visual ways. From 2009-2011 I worked for The Wall Street Journal in Asia and was the editorial lead for video content in the region. I worked with more than a dozen bureaus to create both breaking news stories, regular series and produced enterprising multimedia projects. My reporting in Asia includes stories about China's property market, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and climate change issues in Vietnam's Mekong Delta.</p>

            <p>The way I teach is very informed by my work experience: I've hired and worked with a range of people &mdash; from freelance videographers, photographers, developers and writers to full-time reporters whose pitches I edit and hone. I will hold your assignments to a high standard and expect you to be working independently. I believe that this will prepare you for real newsrooms and help you deal with editors who are strapped for time and expect high-quality work. Don't be worried, I will still give you advice on your stories and we will workshop ideas in class to help guide your progress. But the goal is for you to come out of this not just with tech skills but also with an understanding of what might be expected of you in newsrooms.</p>
            

            <h2>Plagiarism and Copyright</h2>

            <p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.</p>

            <p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue.</p>

            <p>Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.</p>

            <p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.</p>

            <p>If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.</p>

            <p>The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/" target="_blank">Citizen Media Law Project</a> is an excellent resource.</p>

            <p>When in doubt: ask.</p>
            <h2>Office hours</h2>

            <p>By appointment or email me. Please allow 2-3 days for me to reply.</p>

            <h2>Lesson Plan Changes</h2>
