            <h1>Ohai there<a href="http://youtu.be/7mMyV2YQgAA" style="text-decoration:none; color:#363636;">!</a> Welcome to Storytelling with Data + Interactivity</h1>

            <h2>Course objectives</h2>
            <p>The Data/Interactivity 10-week portion of this course introduces students to the essential concepts, tools, and story forms in multimedia storytelling. Students learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, leverage existing frameworks and libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery), and pitch, report, produce, and critique interactive, media-rich news packages.</p>
            <p>The course covers four common multimedia story forms (slideshows, charts, maps, and quizzes), which allow students to explore the different narrative potential of each, and to delve into data, coding, design, and interactivity. This module covers fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="training-col12 panel" id="outcomes">
            <h2>Course outcomes</h2>
            <p>We're going to cover four story forms that touch on a range of skills you can use throughout your career. Sometimes this class will feel like a whirlwind, and you won't have a chance to perfect every story you produce. That's okay! That is how you will often have to operate in the newsroom as well.</p>

            <p>If you want to build on what you learn this semester, take newsgames or data visualization or take advantage of coaching to incorporate these into your stories in other classes. Students will leave this module with experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing a basic HTML page</li>
                <li>Using an FTP client to publish content online</li>
                <li>Incorporating external javascript libraries to create basic interactions</li>
                <li>Crafting good questions to ensure they can find useful technical assistance when they need it</li>
                <li>Creating basic maps and charts that convey information clearly</li>
                <li>Reporting and producing stories with data and interactivity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students will also have experience telling meaningful and complete stories in interactive formats where space is at a premium.</p>

            <h2>Syllabus Overview</h2>
            <img src="images/schedule.png" style="width:100%">

           <h2>Story Guidelines</h2>

            <p>Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well.</p>
            
            <p>Every story you produce for our class should include clear source information for any data or images that you did not produce yourself.</p>

            <h2>Specific Story Requirements</h2>

            <p><b>Slideshow:</b> your slideshow should include six to ten different images with captions. Each caption should be 20 to 100 words.</p>
            <p><b>Map: </b>your map can be a map of points or shapes, but should include a clear, thoughtful title and a caption that tells us why we're looking at this map. Your caption should be between 50 and 150 words.</p>
            <p><b>Quiz:</b> your quiz should include four to six questions with two to four possible answers each.</p>
            <p><b>Chart:</b> your chart assignment should use data with news interest and inlude a title and caption that direct readers to a clear takeaway (which is to say, they should know why they are looking at this chart)</p>
            
            <p>Remember: titles and captions are part of your story. Work is not complete without them.</p>

            <h2>Faculty</h2>
            <p><a href="mailto:lam.vo@journalism.cuny.edu" target="_blank">lam.vo@journalism.cuny.edu</a></p>
            <p>I'm <a href="http://lamthuyvo.com" target="_blank">an interactive editor for Al Jazeera America</a>, where I lead a team of coder-journalists and cover poverty-related stories. Before coming to Al Jazeera, I was a multimedia producer for NPR's Planet Money where I created interactives, data visualizations, videos and photographs to explain economic issues in visual ways. From 2009-2011 I worked for The Wall Street Journal in Asia and was the editorial lead for video content in the region. I worked with more than a dozen bureaus to create both breaking news stories, regular series and produced enterprising multimedia projects. My reporting in Asia includes stories about China's property market, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and climate change issues in Vietnam's Mekong Delta.</p>

            <p>The way I teach is very informed by my work experience: I've hired and worked with a range of people &mdash; from freelance videographers, photographers, coders and writers to full-time coder-reporters and videographers whose pitches I edit and hone. I will hold your assignments to a high standard and expect you to be working independently. I believe that this will prepare you for real newsrooms and help you deal with editors who are strapped for time and expect high-quality work. Don't be worried, I will still give you advice on your stories and we will workshop ideas in class to help guide your progress. But the goal is for you to come out of this not just with tech skills but also with an understanding of what might be expected of you in newsrooms.</p>
            
            <h2>Tumblr and Digital Storage</h2>
            <p>Your major stories will be uploaded to CUNY's Digital Storage server. Note that this web hosting will be available to you for two years after you graduate, so you should make plans to backup work you are proud of and find hosting for it off of campus servers. Some assignments will be posted to a class blog. Students will be required to present their stories in class for critique. Posts to the class blog are public by default, but you can choose to keep them private if you prefer. </p>
            
            <h2>Software Requirements and Accounts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Cyberduck (FTP client to transfer files to the server)</li>
                <li>Sublime Text (text editor)</li>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator</li>
                <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                <li>Google Spreadsheets (which is available as apps from your Google Drive)</li>
                <li>Google Chrome as your Web browser</li>
                <li>JS Fiddle account</li>
                <li>CartoDB account (before you create your CartoDB account, make sure you have the information you need to get the free academic version)</li>
                <li>CUNY Digital Storage account</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>Your grade in this 10-week portion of the course is determined by two factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participation (20%)</li>
                <li>Successful completion of four multimedia stories (80%, each assigment is worth 20%)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your participation includes attending all classes and being punctual, being active in discussions, workshops and critiques, and participating in all in-class hands-on activities.</p>
            
            <p>Grades for your interactive stories are broken down as: Pitch (20%), Final (80%). You are required to pitch, report, and produce a story for each of the forms. Your course grade depends on successfully meeting the requirements for each story and <b>meeting all deadlines</b>.</p>

            <p>A complete pitch should tell us who cares, why we care now, and what pre-reporting you've done. You must include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a proposed title or headline</li>
                <li>a news hook, or explanation of why this story matters now. Why should I care?</li>
                <li>your nut that captures the essence of the story. 1-2 sentences only</li>
                <li>a description of and link your potential source(s), whether a database, character, or expert contact.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Plagiarism and Copyright</h2>

            <p>It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. Plagiarism may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.</p>

            <p>In addition to being a serious academic issue, copyright is a serious legal issue.</p>

            <p>Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.</p>

            <p>Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.</p>

            <p>If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.</p>

            <p>The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/" target="_blank">Citizen Media Law Project</a> is an excellent resource.</p>

            <p>When in doubt: ask.</p>
